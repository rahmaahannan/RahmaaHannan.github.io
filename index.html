<h2>How to set colours in HTML.</h2>
<p>Problem: I think a pink header would totally look awesome. I don't know how, though.</p>
<p>Answer: For a pink header you add "style="background-color:" inside your header bracket. Followed by the hex code of the colour you want. </p>
<p>Example: "&lt h1 style="background-color:#FFBFF8;"&gtPINK&gt/h1&gt" </p>
