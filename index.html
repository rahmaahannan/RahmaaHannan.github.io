  <h2>How I decorated my page. (9/11/2025)</h2>
 <p>Problem: I really wanted my page to be bright and cool!  </p>
<p>Answer: I had the coolest idea of a adding a pink background. I realised i needed it to contrast my text, so I added a cool gradient from white to pink. <br> The text still didn't pop out :-( but luckily, I remembered my header had a background and a border! So I thought why not add it to my posts? I learnt how to add a border and background. It was farely easy! <br> Finally, my page looked decent. Something was abit off though. Maybe it was the random "look at my vectors work" so to clear it up, I added a nav bar. <br> But it still looked weird. I then decided to change the fonts, it was perfect now! </p>

<h2>How to set colours in HTML. (8/11/2025)</h2>
<p>Problem: I think a pink header would totally look awesome. I don't know how, though.</p>
<p>Answer: For a pink header you add "style="background-color:" inside your header bracket. Followed by the hex code of the colour you want. </p>
<p>Example: "&lt h1 style="background-color:#FFBFF8;"&gtPINK&gt/h1&gt" </p>

  <h2>How I customised my welcome heading. (8/11/2025)</h2>
 <p>Problem: I wanted to make my header stand out, but I was unsure on how to approach it.  </p>
<p>Answer: I centered my title instead of leaning it left. It still wasn't enough, but it looked better.<br>I firstly decided my main colour, which is pink. Using this information, I added a border and, experimented with the colours. I settled on a solid dark contrasting pink border with my light background pink. <br>I realised the HTML had a section for border style. It was listed as "solid". This intrigued me so I found different styles. I soon ended up choosing the dashed border.</p>
