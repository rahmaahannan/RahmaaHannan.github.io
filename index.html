<h1 style="background-color:Pink;">Welcome to Rahmaa's beginning of Mathematics! :-D</h1>


<p> Take a look at how I work out vectors <a href="108_Vectors P7.pdf"> here! </a> </p>

<h2>How to set colours in HTML. (8/11/2025)</h2>
<p>Problem: I think a pink header would totally look awesome. I don't know how, though.</p>
<p>Answer: For a pink header you add "style="background-color:" inside your header bracket. Followed by the hex code of the colour you want. </p>
<p>Example: "&lt h1 style="background-color:#FFBFF8;"&gtPINK&gt/h1&gt" </p>


<h2>How I customised my welcome heading. (8/11/2025)</h2>
<p>Problem: I wanted to make my header stand out, but I was unsure on how to approach it.  </p>
<p>Answer: I centered my title instead of leaning it left. It still wasn't enough, but it looked better.<br>I firstly decided my main colour, which is pink. Using this information, I added a border and, experimented with the colours. I settled on a solid dark contrasting pink border with my light background pink. <br>I realised the HTML had a section for border style. It was listed as "solid". This intrigued me so I found different styles. I soon ended up choosing the dashed border.</p>
