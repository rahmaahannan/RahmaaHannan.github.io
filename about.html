 <h2> Hey, I'm Rahmaa! 👋</h2>
<p> I’m a Y11 student currently doing my GCSEs. My interests revolve around problem-solving and mathematical ideas, which is why I started this website. I plan to develop it even more throughout college and A-levels, broadening the content as I learn. I’m hoping to take Further Maths, Maths, and Economics, I’ve been building up my skills to make those goals quite realistic.  </p>
<p>
I just finished my mocks, but I’m still revising GCSE content and slowly dipping into A-level topics. I've realised maths shows up everywhere. Even in subjects which claim they’re “number-free.” But they always end up relying on statistics, patterns, or equations. It's fascinating to know that everything around us reduces to structure: shapes, curves, area, volume. I think the reason I like maths the most is because, you can actually break things down and understand them just by following the logic.</p>
<p>My profile picture is based on Archimedes' Method Of Exhaustion, which you can learn more on the post made on (15/11/2025). P.S if you long-press my profile picture, it does a little cute animation! </p>

<h2>Independent Studies: Nature’s Law: Fibonacci 🌻 (18/11/25)</h2>
<p> Have you ever wondered why things around you look the way they do? Is it by coincidence or something far greater? However, such knowledge is unfathomable to our minds. Yet we discover patterns and sequences, clues dragging us closer to the answer of "Why?". These same patterns appear everywhere: in sunflower spirals, seashells, and even animals. No one is exempt from Nature's Law, or better known as the Fibonacci sequence. A simple concept yet fundamental to the organisation of life. This sequence is defined by the relation F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-2</sub> + F<sub>n-1</sub> meaning each term will always be the sum of the previous two. </p>
<p>But what is the Fibonacci Sequence? How was it discovered? Well, to your suprise it wasn't Leonardo Bonacci. He was a middleman, a traveller, exposed to mathmatical texts coming out of India and the Arab world. However, Bonacci wrote a very important book "Liber Abaci" which popularised in Europe. It introduced the famous rabbit problem: <i> "How many pairs of rabbits will one pair produce in a year?" </i>His answer is now credited as the famous Fibonacci sequence. Yet, this familiar pattern "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8..." was actually a pre-existing concept, used to count syllables in Sanskrit poetry. It was famously studied by a Gujarati mathmatician called Hemachandra. </p>
<p>I believe it's also important to credit scientists like Stéphane Douady and Yves Couder. And even naturalist Charles Bonnet. Bonnet discovered that plants follow a spiral leaf arrangement, called phyllotaxis. Douady and Couder built on this, conducting experiments, showing how meristem growth naturally forms Fibonacci spirals. These discoveries led to what we know as the Fibonacci sequence now. Or what we connote it to. </p>
<p> Such a simple concept, yet in my opinion, it demonstrates a blueprint for optimal growth strategies in nature. I think this is a really cool sequence despite its messy, miscredited history. My favourite example of the Fibonacci sequence is in sunflowers, you can find a simulation <a href = "https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/labs/skondo/simulators/fibonacci.html">here</a> </p>

<h2 id = "PiMethod"> Independent Studies: Archimedes' approximation of Pi. (15/11/2025)</h2>
<p> Out of curiosity, I wondered how we ended up with the value of Pi. Firstly, we need to know, what is Pi? Pi is a constant used to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its diameter, only when Pi is used as a constant of it proportionality. Algebraically, we write this as  c &#8733 d when k = &#960. Or in simpler terms, c = &#960d.   </p>

<p> For this post, we'll focus on the Method of Exhaustion. Archimedes' method started with an inscribed hexagon and a circumscribed hexagon. He calculated the perimeters for both polygons manually, step by step. From this, he knew the circumference of the circle would be greater than the inscribed hexagon but less than the circumscribed hexagon. These values were still too rough to approximate &#960 accurately, so he repeated the method, doubling the number of sides each time: 6 → 12 → 24 → 48 → 96. He stopped once he reached 96-sided polygons, the most accurate estimate humanly possible without technology. Archimedes concluded that pi is greater than (3<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>) but less than (3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>). <br> This is often written as (3<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>) &lt &#960 &lt (3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>).
 </p>
 <p> I found it really cool knowing that since pi is a constant, technically any circumference of a circle can be found on a graph. It wouldn't even look that complex it would just be a positive straight line going up. You can even try this yourself or see my version <a href = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9npqixthp1">here</a> on desmos!  </p>
