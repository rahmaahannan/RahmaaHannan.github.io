<h2> Independent Studies: Archimedes' approximation of Pi. (15/11/2025)</h2>
<p> Out of curiosity, I wondered how we ended up with the value of Pi. Firstly, we need to know, what is Pi? Pi is a constant used to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its diameter, only when Pi is used as a constant of it proportionality. Algebraically, we write this as  c &#8733 d when k = &#960. Or in simpler terms, c = &#960d.   </p>

<p> For this post, we'll focus on the Method of Exhaustion. Archimedes' method started with an inscribed hexagon and a circumscribed hexagon. He calculated the perimeters for both polygons manually, step by step. From this, he knew the circumference of the circle would be greater than the inscribed hexagon but less than the circumscribed hexagon. These values were still too rough to approximate &#960 accurately, so he repeated the method, doubling the number of sides each time: 6 → 12 → 24 → 48 → 96. He stopped once he reached 96-sided polygons, the most accurate estimate humanly possible without technology. Archimedes concluded that pi is greater than (3<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>) but less than (3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>). <br> This is often written as (3<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>) &lt &#960 &lt (3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>).
 </p>
 <p> I found it really cool knowing that since pi is a constant, technically any circumference of a circle can be found on a graph. It wouldn't even look that complex it would just be a positive straight line going up. You can even try this yourself or see my version <a href = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9npqixthp1">here</a> on desmos!  </p>
