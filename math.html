<h2>EXACT TRIG VALUES (10/11/2025)</h2>
<p> 
This is from <mark>AQA GCSE paper 1 (H), November 2022</mark>. I attempted a couple of questions. The question I had the most fun with was <strong><i><a href= "AQA_Paper1(H)_Nov2022_Q23.pdf">Q23</a></i></strong>. It was really easy, I would probably give it a<mark> difficulty level of 0.5/5</mark>. Im not even sure if giving a decimal counts as a rating, but this was super easy and fun. However, a <mark>big prerequisite you need to know is exact trigonometric values</mark>. I personally use the "0, 1, 2, 3, 4" rule. Considering it's from a non-calculator paper, I find using the "hand" rule quite inefficient and more prone to forgetting. If you really want to attempt this question, I advise you learn the trick I use, and not the hand one which most people use. <mark>Another prerequisite would be knowing how to rationalise fractions with surds. Or in general just working with surds.</mark>
</p>
<p class = "working">
Now, heres how I attempted the question. Firstly, I drew out my trig values. This was a table going from 0 to 4, 4 to 0. The first line was my <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">sin</span> values. The second line was my <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">cos</span> values. <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">Tan</span> would be the 2 numbers on the same column divided by each other. For example, <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">sin 90 = 1</span> and <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">cos 90 = 0</span> so <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">tan 90 = 0</span> because <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">1/0 = 0</span>. Well, technically <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">tan 90</span> is regarded as <a href= "glossary.html">mathmatically undefined*</a>, since it results in a division of <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">0</span>. If you want to learn more you can refer to tan graphs in your own time. But I think they're a mess and confusing, compared to the sin and cos graphs. </p>
<p>Anyways, after I found out my values, the question asks us " <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(4)(sin 30)(tan 30)(cos 30) = sin y</span>". This means the answer I get can be self-assesed since it clearly states it has to refer back to the table of value I drew out. I broke it down in steps, I firstly did <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(4)(sin 30)</span> which was <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(4)(1/2) or 2</span>. Then I multiply it by the next value "<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">tan 30</span>". So <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(2)(tan 30)</span> which using our table is <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(2)<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;"></span>(<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><span>&#8730;</span>3</sub>)</span> or <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;"><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub><span>&#8730;</span>3</sub></span>. They then ask us to times it by <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">cos 30</span>. Again using our values we get <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub><span>&#8730;</span>3</sub>)</span> <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(<sup><span>&#8730;</span>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>)</span>. Now lucky for us they just cancel each other out! That means the answer is <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">1</span>. But it doesn't end there. They tell us that we need to find y, since we now know <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">1 = sin y</span>. We can refer back to our table which leads us to our final answer, <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">sin 90 = 1</span>. So <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">y = 90</span>.

<h2> EQUATIONS ON A TANGENT (9/11/2025) </h2>

<p> This is from <mark>AQA GCSE Paper 1 (H), June 2017</mark>. I attempted 2 big markers from the paper. The first question I did was <strong><i><a href= "AQA_Paper1(H)_June2017_Q27.pdf">Q27</a></i></strong> which I enjoyed the most. It was farely easy, I would give it a<mark> difficulty rating of 1/5.</mark> Which is quite low for a 4 marker. Some<mark> prerequisites are knowing how to find values in the equation of a line.</mark></p>

<p class= "working"> They ask us to work out the equation of the <a href= "glossary.html">tangent*</a>. To do this question we are shown the tangent has point P <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(-1,4)</span> perpendicular to the circumference of a circle. This circle has the center of  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(0,0)</span>. Lucky for us, that means there are no hidden values nor any extra working out. I also noticed that the slant of the tangent goes up from left to right. This means that the <a href= "glossary.html">gradient*</a> will be positive. </p>

<p class="working">Now that the observations were out of the way, it was time to work the answer out. They give us the format for our answer,  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">y = mx + c</span>. From my own knowlege I know that this is the equation of a line. My first thought is to find out the gradient. I use the coordinates given P <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(-1,4)</span> and do  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">4/-1</span> to find the gradient. This gives us the answer of  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">-4</span>. However, that's not the end since it should be positve not negative. As mentioned before, we're finding out the line <a href= "glossary.html">perpendicular*</a> to the <a href= "glossary.html">circumference*</a>, this means that its slope is always the negative <a href= "glossary.html">reciporcal*</a>. So  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">-4</span> would be  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">1/4</span>. Now that we have found our gradient we can substitute the values. <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;"> y = (1/4)x + c.</span> We need to find the y-intercept (c). The best way is to plug in the coordinates given. This gave me  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">4 = (1/4)(-1) + c.</span> Or if we simplify it <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;"> 4 = -0.25 + c.</span> Through rearranging or even mental maths its clear to see that the <a href= "glossary.html">y-intercept*</a> is  <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">4.25</span>. Finally, we have found the answer which is <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">y = 1/4x + 4.25</span>.   </p>

<h2>  VECTORS (8/11/2025) </h2>
<p> 

This is from <mark>Edexcel Linear 1MAO Vectors</mark>. I attempted the whole worksheet successfully.<mark>The difficulty level was 2/5.</mark> Solely, because it was difficult writing down my directions since my writing kept getting mixed up with the question itself. Additionally, some <mark>prerequisites are the basics of vectors. Just Unit Vector Form.</mark> The question that interested me and I am focusing on is <strong><i><a href="108_Vectors P7.pdf">Q6</a></i></strong>

</p> 

<p class ="working">
i) The first question asks us to find OS in terms of p and q. To do this I first found PQ, which was from OP backwards to OQ. (-p + q). The question then tells us "S is the midpoint of PQ." Using this information I now know PS and SQ are both (1/2)(q-p). This made it easier to find OS since I can now go from OP to PS without any unknown values. This means that OS = OP + PS which is p + (1/2)q + (1/2)p. Which leads us to our answer that OS = (1/2)q + (1/2)p.
</p>

<p class = working>

ii) The second question tells us to show RS is <a href= "glossary.html">parallel*</a> to OQ. To do this, I know that RP = (1/2)p, this is useful since to get to <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">RS</span> we need to go from <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">RP to PS</span>. We found out previously that <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">PS = (1/2)(q-p)</span> This means <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">RS = (1/2)p - (1/2)p + (1/2)q</span>. If we simplify it we get <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">RS = (1/2)q</span>. Luckily, <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">OQ</span> is given to us <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">(OQ = q)</span> This means that <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">2RS = OQ</span>. We have now successfully shown <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">RS</span> is parallel to <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif;">OQ. </span>
