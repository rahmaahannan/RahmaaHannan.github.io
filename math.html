<h2> NOTE: </h2> 
<p> This section will mainly have Edexcel and AQA GCSE Higher questions. I might do abit of Further Math GCSE questions or Alevel content. <br> For my layout, I will always place prerequisites to do the question, my answer and how difficult i think it is. I will also state the exam board and paper, most of them will be Paper 1 Non-calc. <br> Sometimes you won't see the paper nor the exam board listed but i will state the source  where I got the question from. .</p>

<h2> EQUATIONS ON A TANGENT (9/11/2025) </h2>
<p> This is from <mark>AQA GCSE Paper 1 (H), June 2017</mark>. I attempted 2 big markers from the paper. The first question I did was <strong><i><a href= "AQA Paper 1 (H), June 2017 Q27.pdf">Q27</a></i></strong> which I enjoyed the most. It was farely easy, I would give it a<mark> difficulty rating of 1/5.</mark> Which is quite low for a 4 marker. Some<mark> prerequisites are knowing how to find values in the equation of a line.</mark></p>
<p> They ask us to work out the equation of the tangent. To do this question we are shown the tangent has point P(-1,4) perpendicular to the circumference of a circle. This circle has the center of (0,0). Lucky for us, that means there are no hidden values nor any extra working out. I also noticed that the slant of the tangent goes up from left to right. This means that the gradient will be positive. </p>
<p>Now that the observations were out of the way, it was time to work the answer out. They give us the format for our answer, y = mx + c. From my own knowlege I know that this is the equation of a line. My first thought is to find out the gradient. I use the co-ordinates given P(-1,4) and do 4/-1 to find the gradient(change in y/ change in x). This gives us the answer of -4. However, that's not the gradient since it should be positve not negative. Since we're finding out the line PERPENDICULAR to the circumference, this means that its perpendicular slope is the negative reciporcal. So -4 would be 1/4. Now that we have found our gradient we can substitute the values. y = (1/4)x + c. We need to find the y-intercept (c). The best way is to plug in the coordinates given. This gave me 4 = (1/4)(-1) + c. Or if we simplify it 4 = -0.25 + c. Through rearranging or even mental maths its clear to see that the y-intercept is 4.25. Finally, we have found the answer which is y = 1/4x + 4.25.   </p>

<h2>  VECTORS (8/11/2025) </h2>
<p> This is from <mark>Edexcel Linear 1MAO Vectors</mark>. I attempted the whole worksheet successfully.<mark>The difficulty level was 2/5.</mark> Solely, because it was difficult writing down my directions since my writing kept getting mixed up with the question itself. Additionally, some <mark>prerequisites are the basics of vectors. Just Unit Vector Form.</mark> The question that interested me and I am focusing on is <strong><i><a href="108_Vectors P7.pdf">Q6</a></i></strong></p> 
<p>i) The first question asks us to find OS in terms of p and q. To do this I first found PQ, which was from OP backwards to OQ. (-p + q). The question then tells us "S is the midpoint of PQ." Using this information I now know PS and SQ are both (1/2)(q-p). This made it easier to find OS since I can now go from OP to PS without any unknown values. This means that OS = OP + PS which is p + (1/2)q + (1/2)p. Which leads us to our answer that OS = (1/2)q + (1/2)p. </p>
<p>ii) The second question tells us to show RS is parallel to OQ. To do this, I know that RP = (1/2)p, this is useful since to get to RS we need to go from RP to PS. We found out previously that PS = (1/2)(q-p) This means RS = (1/2)p - (1/2)p + (1/2)q. If we simplify it we get RS = (1/2)q. Luckily, OQ is given to us (OQ = q) This means that 2RS = OQ. We have now successfully shown RS is parallel to OQ.
