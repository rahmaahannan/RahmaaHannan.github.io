<h2> NOTE: </h2> 
<p> This section will mainly have Edexcel and AQA GCSE Higher questions. I might do abit of Further Math GCSE questions or Alevel content. <br> For my layout, I will always place prerequisites to do the question, my answer and how difficult i think it is. I will also state the exam board and paper, most of them will be Paper 1 Non-calc. <br> Sometimes you won't see the paper nor the exam board listed but i will state the source  where I got the question from. .</p>

<h2>  VECTORS (8/11/2025) </h2>
<p> This is from <mark>Edexcel Linear 1MAO Vectors</mark>. I attempted the whole worksheet successfully.<mark>The difficulty level was 2/5.</mark> Solely, because it was difficult writing down my directions since my writing kept getting mixed up with the question itself. Additionally, some <mark>prerequisites are the basics of vectors. Just Unit Vector Form.</mark> The question that interested me and I am focusing on is <strong><i><a href="108_Vectors P7.pdf">Q6</a></i></strong></p> 
<p>i) The first question asks us to find OS in terms of p and q. To do this I first found PQ, which was from OP backwards to OQ. (-p + q). The question then tells us "S is the midpoint of PQ." Using this information I now know PS and SQ are both (1/2)(q-p). This made it easier to find OS since I can now go from OP to PS without any unknown values. This means that OS = OP + PS which is p + (1/2)q + (1/2)p. Which leads us to our answer that OS = (1/2)q + (1/2)p. </p>
<p>ii) The second question tells us to show RS is parallel to OQ. To do this, I know that RP = (1/2)p, this is useful since to get to RS we need to go from RP to PS. We found out previously that PS = (1/2)(q-p) This means RS = (1/2)p - (1/2)p + (1/2)q. If we simplify it we get RS = (1/2)q. Luckily, OQ is given to us (OQ = q) This means that 2RS = OQ. We have now successfully shown RS is parallel to OQ.
